The FuelCalc.exe file in this folder is a compiled python script which takes various inputs
to establish how much money you are keeping / losing from the fuel allowance using the price of 
1 litre of fuel, your cars MPG, pence per mile compensation amount and how many miles you have driven.

NB. This app only accepts whole numbers/integers at each stage except for miles per gallon which can
 have a single decimal place in the input. Any deviation from this, ie. trying to input text or decimals where not advised 
will break the app and you will have to close and reopen it.

After entering each number, press enter to progress.

I have not manually verified that the outputs are correct but it seems to be from what I've tried.

Trying to use the app to assess a weeks worth of milage should be fine however you can only enter one MPG figure,
rather than one for each day, therefor you would want to roughly average your weeks MPG. 

This is a very simple script, no results are saved or sent anywhere.
